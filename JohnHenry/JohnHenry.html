<h3>A true story about me</h3>
<p>Once I had to  go to the hospital. My mommy says I almost died! Mommy and daddy were on vacation for a really long time. I thought they were never coming back and I was really sad. I couldn't go pee pee. My friend Momo was feeding me but I wasn't hungry. He knew something was wrong because I usually like to eat alot!
    We went to the <a href ="petvet link">Pet vets</a> right away! I stayed in the hospital a week. They took good care of me there and with the help of my vet <a href="dr otten link">Dr. Otten</a> I made it home. Thank's for saving me pet vets but I don't want to see you again anytime soon!</p> <hr />
